  <p class="title">Gift - A Github Finder Tool</p>
  <p><em>GIFT</em> is a web application designed to help users to search and visualize information about github users and repositories. It supports different types of search: search for a <em>specific user</em>; search for <em>users</em> based on their <em>login</em> or <em>fullnames</em>; search for <em>repositories</em> based on their names or in specific information that might be present in their <em>descriptions</em> or <em>readme</em> files. These modes of search are implemented with the help of the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub REST API v3</a>. The visualization of a user profile in <em>GIFT</em> includes a list of all his/her public repositories sorted by the time of their creation. Repositories returned by one of the possible search modes are sorted with respect to the number of stars they possess. A visual account of the total number of searches are presented by charts created with the library <a href="https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/">Chart.js</a>. We also use the REST API pagination facilities to implement page navigation whenever the number of results returned exceeds what is predetermined for that particular search mode. This application is implemented with <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>Bootstrap</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Python</em>, <em>Django</em> and the <em>SQLite</em> database.</p>
